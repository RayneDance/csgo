// eDPI = Effective DPI.
// Effective DPI is your in-game sensitvity times your DPI times windows sensitivity.
// Tournament computers will be set to 6/11 with no accel.
// You may need to figure out your eDPI if you use non-default windows setting.
//If you use a non-default windows setting, table below:
// 1/11 = 0.0625
// 2/11 = 0.0125
// 3/11 = 0.25
// 4/11 = 0.5
// 5/11 = 0.75

// 7/11 = 1.5
// 8/11 = 2
// 9/11 = 2.5
// 10/11= 3
// 11/11= 2.5
//dpi * sens * win = eDPI
//800 * 1.3 * 1 = 1040
//400 * 2.6 * 1 = 1040
//If you play with non-standard windows settings, use the table and above formla to find your eDPI.
